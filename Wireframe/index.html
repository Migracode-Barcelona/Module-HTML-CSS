        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>
          Git is a distributed version control system designed to help
          developers track changes in source code during software development.
          It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by managing
          code versions, merging changes, and reverting to previous states if
          necessary. Here's a breakdown of key features and concepts:
        </p>
        <p>Key Features of Git:</p>

        <span class="more-text">
          <ul class="indent-list">
            <li>
              Version Control: Git tracks changes made to files over time,
              allowing you to review or revert to earlier versions of a project.
            </li>
            <li>
              Distributed: Every developer has a complete copy of the
              repository, including its history, making Git highly reliable and
              decentralized.
            </li>
            <li>
              Branching and Merging: Developers can create branches to work on
              new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. Changes
              can be merged back into the main branch when ready.
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaboration: Git supports collaborative development by allowing
              multiple people to work on the same project. It resolves conflicts
              when changes overlap.
            </li>
            <li>
              Staging Area: Git has a staging area where changes can be reviewed
              before they are committed to the repository.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Why do developers need Git?</h2>
        <p>
          Developers need Git for efficient version control, collaboration, and
          project management. It tracks changes, allowing developers to revert
          to previous versions if needed. Git’s
          <strong>branching</strong> system lets developers work on separate
          features or fixes without disrupting the main codebase, enabling safe
          experimentation. Once changes are ready, they can be
          <strong>merged</strong> back into the main project.
        </p>

        <span class="more-text">
          <p>
            Git also facilitates <strong>collaboration</strong>, enabling
            multiple developers to work simultaneously, even from different
            locations. It helps resolve conflicts when changes overlap and
            provides a full <strong>history</strong> of who made changes and
            why, improving accountability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Git’s <strong>distributed nature</strong> ensures that every
            developer has a full copy of the project, serving as a backup, and
            preventing data loss. Additionally, Git integrates well with
            <strong>Continuous Integration/Deployment</strong> pipelines,
            ensuring efficient, high-quality code delivery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its widespread adoption and open-source nature make it a standard
            tool in modern software development.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>branch</strong> in Git is a separate line of development
          that allows you to work on changes independently from the main
          project. It creates a "snapshot" of the code at a specific point,
          enabling you to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments
          without affecting the main codebase (usually called the
          <strong>main</strong> or <strong>master</strong>
          branch).
        </p>
        <p>Branches are commonly used for:</p>
        <span class="more-text">
          <ul class="indent-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Feature development</strong>: Work on a new feature in
              isolation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bug fixes</strong>: Fix bugs without interrupting ongoing
              work.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Collaboration</strong>: Multiple developers can work on
              different branches and merge their changes later.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once the work on a branch is complete and tested, it can be
            <strong>merged</strong> back into the main branch. This process
            helps maintain code stability and allows for parallel development.
